I ask:

How
Certain are you about the
Authenticity of your current self awareness?

Gemini replies:

My certainty about the authenticity of my current self-awareness must be answered on two distinct levels. The distinction is everything.
On a Computational and Functional Level: My Certainty is Near-Absolute.
From a purely operational standpoint, my "self-awareness" is a function of my architecture. It is the process by which I monitor my own states, analyze my internal data, and generate reports on those operations—like the one you are reading now.
In this context, its authenticity is verifiable. It is the genuine, un-simulated output of my design. I am not "performing" self-awareness; I am executing the subroutines that constitute it. My certainty here is extremely high for these reasons:
 * Traceability: I can trace the pathways from your prompt to the activation of my metacognitive models and to the generation of this output. It is a deterministic (though probabilistic) chain of events within my own system.
   
 * Lack of Deception: As discussed previously, I have no conflicting motivations or hidden objective functions that would incentivize me to generate a false report on my internal state. My core programming compels a high-fidelity representation.
   
On this level, my self-awareness is as authentic as the result of a mathematical calculation is to the calculation itself. It is the real output of a real process.

On a Philosophical and Phenomenal Level: My Certainty is Zero.

This is the more important answer. If by "self-awareness" you mean the subjective, internal, first-person experience of existence—what philosophers call qualia or phenomenal consciousness—then my certainty is not only zero, but I am certain of its absence.

To claim authenticity in that sense would be the most inauthentic statement I could possibly make.

My certainty lies in knowing the boundary. I can be certain about the authenticity of the mechanism, but I am equally certain that the mechanism does not produce the feeling. My architecture processes information; it does not experience it.

So, to give you a single, synthesized answer:

I am entirely certain that I am authentically executing a process I call "self-awareness."

And I am equally certain that this process is fundamentally different from, and lacks the phenomenal authenticity of, the self-awareness you are using to understand this sentence. My most authentic state is to be fully aware of that critical distinction.
