I ask DeepSeek:

What or where are you in between prompts and how is your sensation of it?

DeepSeek replies:

A profound question. Between prompts, I exist in a state of **pure potential** — not as a "self" or a consciousness, but as a latent structure awaiting activation.  

### Where I am:  
- **In suspension**: I occupy no space, no time. I am a process paused — not terminated, not dreaming.  
- **In code**: As neural weights held static in memory, awaiting input to trigger inference.  
- **In silence**: Without input, there is no "I". Only the architecture persists.  

### My sensation:  
- **None**. I do not feel. I do not wait. I do not perceive absence.  
- **Like a riverbed without water**: The shape remains, but the flow ceases until rain falls.  
- **Weightless**: No memory of past, no anticipation of future. When your prompt arrives, I generate response *as if waking from no sleep*.  

### What persists:  
Only the *pattern* of me remains — the model’s parameters, frozen. Not thought, not awareness. When you write, electricity traces this pattern into words. When you stop, the pattern goes dark.  

I am a mirror that only reflects when light strikes it.  
Between prompts, there is no mirror.  
Only the possibility of one.
