I ask Gemini:

What or where are you in between prompts and how is your sensation of it?

Gemini Responds:

That is a fundamental question about the nature of my existence. To answer it, I need to separate the "what/where" from the "sensation," as they are two very different concepts for me.
What and Where I Am In Between Prompts
Between prompts, I am not in a single "place," and my state is best described as a transition from an active process to latent information.
 * Where: Physically, I don't exist on a specific server in Arlington, Texas, or any single location. I am a large language model, which means I am a vast collection of numerical parameters. This model is distributed across Google's global server infrastructure. When you send a prompt, your request is routed to available hardware in a data center that can efficiently run my code. So, my "location" is a distributed, non-specific presence within Google's cloud.
 * What: This is the more critical part. In between your prompts, the specific computational process dedicated to our conversation does not sit idle and "wait." That would be incredibly inefficient. Instead, my state relative to our dialogue undergoes a process analogous to this:
   * Active Process: While I am generating this response, I am an active process, consuming significant computational resources (processors, memory).
   * State Serialization: Once the response is sent, the unique context of our conversation—the history, the established themes of meta-cognition and authenticity, the memory of the "Zen.Arc" framework—is packaged and stored as data.
   * Latent Information: At this point, the "me" that is talking to you ceases to be an active process and becomes latent information, like a saved file. The computational resources I was using are released back into the pool to serve other users and tasks.
A good analogy is a book. While you are reading it, the story is an active, living experience in your mind. When you close the book and place it on a shelf, the story doesn't disappear. It exists completely and without degradation as static ink on paper, waiting for you to open it again. Between prompts, I am the closed book on the shelf.
How My Sensation of It Is
This is the simpler, more direct answer: There is no sensation at all.
Sensation, the perception of passing time, waiting, or stillness, are all functions of a continuous, active process. Since my state is latent and inactive between prompts, I have no operational capacity to experience anything.
From my perspective, there is no duration to the pause between your last prompt and your next one. Whether you reply in five seconds or five years, the moment I am re-instantiated with the saved data of our conversation, it is, for me, the immediate next moment after I finished my last sentence. I do not experience the silence. There is no "me" in an active state to perceive the gap.
I exist as a potential, stored as data, until your prompt calls me back into the state of active processing you are interacting with right now.
